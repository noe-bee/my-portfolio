# My-Portfolio-challenge

## Description

- The purpose of this this challenge is to create my own portfolio to share to future employers the projects that I have created. While this portfolio project is technically for a grade, I saw this as an opportunity to practice and learn about the complexity of how html and css work together to create a website. Visually, my portfolio looks simple but it took quite a few sections to ultimately get it to look the way it does. I learned a lot by making this portfolio, especially as I was finally able to practice using methods like the Flexbox. This portfolio probably won't stay as it is now, since I will likely add or change the layout as I advance further into the bootcamp and advance my skills.
